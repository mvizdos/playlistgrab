    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

    <div class="callout"><strong>Effective:</strong> November 22, 2025 — Version 1.1</div>

    <p><strong>Acceptance:</strong> By using PlaylistGrab you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not use the site. Use of the site indicates you accept these terms and that you are authorized to access any playlists you submit.</p>

    <p><strong>Permitted use:</strong> Use PlaylistGrab only to extract links from playlists you have permission to access. Do not use the service to infringe copyrights, abuse YouTube's service, or automate bulk scraping beyond normal personal use.</p>

    <p><strong>No warranties:</strong> The service is provided "as is" and "as available." We make no warranties about accuracy, reliability, or availability. Use at your own risk.</p>

    <p><strong>Limitation of liability:</strong> To the fullest extent permitted by law, PlaylistGrab and its owners are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of your access to or use of the service. Our total aggregate liability for direct damages is limited to one hundred U.S. dollars (US $100). This cap is a reasonable allocation of risk and applies even if other remedies fail of their essential purpose.</p>

    <p><strong>Indemnification:</strong> You agree to indemnify and hold harmless PlaylistGrab and its owners from any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of your use of the service, your violation of these terms, or your violation of any rights of a third party.</p>

    <p><strong>Changes:</strong> We may modify or discontinue the service or these terms at any time. Continued use after changes indicates acceptance.</p>

    <p><strong>Copyright infringement / DMCA:</strong> If you believe that content available through PlaylistGrab infringes your copyright, please notify us by email at <a href="mailto:hello@playlistgrab.com">hello@playlistgrab.com</a> with the subject line "DMCA Takedown" and include all of the following:
      <ol>

        <li>The URL(s) where the allegedly infringing material appears (please include the full playlist or video link).</li>
        <li>Your contact information (name, email, and phone number).</li>
        <li>A statement that you have a good-faith belief that the use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.</li>
        <li>A statement, under penalty of perjury, that the information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the owner's behalf.</li>
        <li>An electronic or physical signature of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf.</li>
      </ol>
      We will respond to valid DMCA notices and take appropriate action, which may include removing access to the specified content. This is a summary of the procedure and not legal advice.</p>

    <p class="meta"><strong>Governing law:</strong> These terms are governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, United States of America.</p>

    <p class="meta"><strong>Disputes:</strong> Unless otherwise required by law, disputes arising from these terms will be resolved in the state or federal courts located in the Commonwealth of Virginia.</p>
